# dice_project

This is a simple app. The whole premise of it is as follows:
Press on whatever dice you like and both of them are going to give you a random number.

It is a perfect app to play with friends when you are in need of some dice for Board Games, randomizing turns, or even DnD!

## Important Widgets and functions I used

What helped me the most was the Stateful widget, as it had a memory of the previous dice faces.
I imported dart.math and used a Random(). function in order to get a completely random number. (just like in real life!)
